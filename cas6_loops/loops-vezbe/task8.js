/* Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two
exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print &quot;Fizz&quot; instead of the number, and for numbers
divisible by 5 (and not 3), print &quot;Buzz&quot; instead. When you have that working, modify your
program to print &quot;FizzBuzz&quot;, for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print
&quot;Fizz&quot; or &quot;Buzz&quot; for numbers divisible by only one of those). */
